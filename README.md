To execute the code I used expo which lets you easily run the program on a phone or an emulator

To start in the console type :

npm install

To launch the app run:

npm start

or 

expo start

If you want to use it on a phone download the expo app, and you can link it to the minesweeper with the qr code or link by following the instructions in the app.
