To execute the code I used expo which lets you easily run the program on a phone or an emulator.

To start, in the console type :

npm install

To launch the app, run:

npm start

or 

expo start

Now connect your phone to the same wifi network as your computer, and install the Expo Client app on your device.

On the webpage opened after "expo start" click "Send link with email/SMS..." on the left menu.
You can now open the link sent and you will be able to use the app.
